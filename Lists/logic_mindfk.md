## why skip/exclude last number ? :

```python
items = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

This list has **POSITIONS** (also called indexes). Let me label them:

```
POSITION:    0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
            ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓
VALUE:      0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
```

---

## When you write `items[1:4]`:

The `1` means: **"Start at POSITION 1"**
The `4` means: **"Stop BEFORE position 4"**

Let me show you what Python does step by step:

1. Go to **POSITION 1** → Find value `1` → Take it ✅
2. Go to **POSITION 2** → Find value `2` → Take it ✅
3. Go to **POSITION 3** → Find value `3` → Take it ✅
4. Reach **POSITION 4** → Find value `4` → **STOP! Don't take it!** ❌

**Result:** `[1, 2, 3]`

---

## Why didn't it print 0?

Because you told it to **START at position 1**, not position 0!

- Position 0 contains the value `0` ← You never asked for this
- Position 1 contains the value `1` ← This is where you STARTED

---

## Why didn't it print 4?

Because you told it to **STOP at position 4** (without including it)!

- Position 3 contains the value `3` ← Last one included
- Position 4 contains the value `4` ← This is where you STOPPED (skipped)

---

## THE RULE:

`[start:end]` means:
- **Start** = the position where you BEGIN taking values
- **End** = the position where you STOP (and don't take that one)

So `[1:4]`:
- Starts at position 1 (value 1)
- Stops before position 4 (so you don't get value 4)
- You get: values at positions 1, 2, 3 → which are `1, 2, 3`

---

## What Got Skipped?

**TWO things got skipped:**
1. Everything BEFORE position 1 (so position 0, which has value 0) ← skipped because you started at 1
2. Position 4 and everything after (value 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) ← skipped because you stopped at 4

You got ONLY positions 1, 2, 3 → values `1, 2, 3`

---

## Does This Make Sense Now?

The numbers `1:4` are telling Python **WHERE to start and WHERE to stop** in the list. They are **POSITIONS**, not "give me elements 1 through 4".

# THE REAL REASON behind this logic:

## 1. **So You Can Calculate Length Easily**

When you write `[1:4]`, you want to know: "How many things am I getting?"

**With Python's way (skip the end):**
- `4 - 1 = 3` → You get 3 items. DONE.

**If it included the end:**
- `4 - 1 = 3... wait, that's wrong, I need to add 1... so 4 items`
- You'd have to remember that stupid `+1` every single time

This matters when you're coding because you're constantly calculating lengths in loops, splitting data, etc.

---

## 2. **So You Can Split Things Without Thinking**

Say you have 10 items and want to cut them in half:

**Python's way:**
```python
first = items[0:5]   # Gets 5 items
second = items[5:10] # Gets 5 items
```

See that **5**? It appears in both lines. Where the first part ENDS (5) is exactly where the second part STARTS (5). Clean. No math needed.

**If it included the end:**
```python
first = items[0:4]   # Gets 5 items
second = items[5:9]  # Gets 5 items
```

Now you have to remember: "First ends at 4, so second must start at 5". And if you mess up and do `[0:5]` and `[5:10]`, you'd get item 5 TWICE (in both halves).

---

## 3. **To Avoid "Off-by-One" Bugs**

This is a famous type of bug where you accidentally grab one too many or one too few items. It's one of the most common mistakes in programming.

Python's system reduces these bugs because:
- `[0:n]` always gives you exactly `n` items
- When you chain slices together, the numbers match up perfectly
- No extra `+1` or `-1` adjustments that you can forget

---

## The Bottom Line:

**It's not "natural" or "intuitive"—it's designed to prevent mistakes when you're writing real code.**

Think of it like this: You sacrifice 5 minutes of confusion NOW to save yourself from hundreds of annoying bugs LATER.
