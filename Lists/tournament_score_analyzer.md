# Now: line-by-line, word-by-word explanation

I’ll show a small chunk, then explain **every single token** that matters.

---

### 1)

```python
players = []
```

* `players` — a variable name. We'll use it to store player names.
* `=` — assignment. Put the value on the right into the variable on the left.
* `[]` — an **empty list** (no items yet). Lists hold ordered items (0th, 1st, 2nd...).
* Result: `players` now points to an empty list `[]`.

---

### 2)

```python
scores = []
```

* `scores` — variable for storing scores.
* `[]` — empty list again.
* But **we will use `scores` as a list of lists**. Each element of `scores` will be a list of that player's round scores.
* Example final shape: `scores = [ [p1r1, p1r2, ...], [p2r1, p2r2, ...], ... ]`.

---

### 3)

```python
num_players = int(input("Number of players? "))
```

Breakdown:

* `input("Number of players? ")` — show the text `Number of players? ` on screen, pause, and wait for keyboard input. **Input returns a string**.

  * If user types `3` and presses Enter, `input(...)` returns the string `"3"`.
* `int(...)` — converts a string to an integer (number). `int("3")` → `3` (as number).

  * If user types a non-number like `abc`, `int()` raises `ValueError` (program crashes unless caught).
* `num_players` — variable storing that integer number of players.

So after this line: `num_players` is an integer like `2`, `3`, etc.

---

### 4)

```python
num_rounds = int(input("Number of rounds? "))
```

Same as above, but for rounds per player. `num_rounds` is an integer.

---

### 5) Outer loop start

```python
for p in range(num_players):
```

* `for` — start a loop.
* `p` — loop variable (will take values 0,1,2,...).
* `range(num_players)` — generates numbers from `0` to `num_players - 1`.

  * If `num_players` is `3`, `range(3)` gives `0,1,2`.
* The loop body (indented block that follows) runs once for each player.

**Important:** we use 0-based counting in code. `p` refers to the current player index.

---

### 6)

```python
    name = input(f"Enter name of player {p+1}: ")
```

* `f"Enter name of player {p+1}: "` — an f-string. `{p+1}` is replaced by the value `p+1`.

  * We use `p+1` because humans count players from 1, but our code index `p` starts at 0.
* `input(...)` displays that prompt and reads a string typed by user.
* `name` receives the typed string (like `"Alice"`).

---

### 7)

```python
    players.append(name)
```

* `players.append(...)` — **call** the list method `append` to add the `name` to the end of `players`.
* After this, `players` grows. Example: `["Alice"]`, then `["Alice", "Bob"]`, etc.

---

### 8)

```python
    player_scores = []
```

* `player_scores` — temporary list for this player's round scores.
* `[]` — empty list. We'll fill it with `num_rounds` integers.

---

### 9) Inner loop start

```python
    for r in range(num_rounds):
```

* `r` — loop variable for round index (0..num_rounds-1).
* This loop repeats `num_rounds` times for the current player.

---

### 10)

```python
        score = int(input(f"Score for {name} in round {r+1}: "))
```

* `f"Score for {name} in round {r+1}: "` → builds prompt like: `Score for Alice in round 1: `
* `input(...)` reads a string typed by user.
* `int(...)` converts that string to an integer (`score`).

  * Again, bad input (non-number) causes `ValueError`.
* `score` now holds the numeric score for this player in this round.

---

### 11)

```python
        player_scores.append(score)
```

* Add this `score` to the current player's `player_scores` list.
* After all rounds, `player_scores` might look like `[10, 5, 7]` for 3 rounds.

---

### 12)

```python
    scores.append(player_scores)
```

* After the inner loop finishes (we collected all rounds for this player), we append the full `player_scores` list into `scores`.
* So `scores` becomes a list of lists. Example after two players:

  ```
  scores = [
    [10, 5, 7],  # player 0
    [6, 12, 8]   # player 1
  ]
  ```

---

### 13)

```python
max_score = -float('inf')
min_score = float('inf')
```

* `float('inf')` is Python's positive infinity (a very big number).
* `-float('inf')` is negative infinity (a very small number).
* We initialize `max_score` to negative infinity so any real score will be larger and will replace it.
* We initialize `min_score` to positive infinity so any real score will be smaller and will replace it.

This is a safe way to start so the first checked score becomes both max and min initially.

---

### 14)

```python
max_player = ""
min_player = ""
max_round = 0
min_round = 0
```

* `max_player` / `min_player` — strings to store the name of the player who has the extreme score.
* `max_round` / `min_round` — integers storing which round (we’ll store `j+1` so it’s human readable).
* Start as empty / zero; they will be set when we find scores.

---

### 15) Nested loop to find overall extremes

```python
for i in range(num_players):
    for j in range(num_rounds):
        score = scores[i][j]
```

* Outer loop: `i` iterates players by index (0..num_players-1).
* Inner loop: `j` iterates rounds by index (0..num_rounds-1).
* `scores[i][j]` — **indexing a list of lists**:

  * `scores[i]` → list of player `i` scores.
  * `scores[i][j]` → score of player `i` in round `j`.
* `score` holds the current numeric score we're examining.

---

### 16) Compare for max

```python
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            max_player = players[i]
            max_round = j+1
```

* `if score > max_score:` — check if this score is strictly greater than our current recorded max.
* If true:

  * `max_score = score` — update the numeric max.
  * `max_player = players[i]` — get the player's name (because `players` list stores names in same order).
  * `max_round = j+1` — store the human-friendly round number (add 1 because `j` starts at 0).

---

### 17) Compare for min

```python
        if score < min_score:
            min_score = score
            min_player = players[i]
            min_round = j+1
```

* Same logic but for the minimum. If this score is lower than current min, update min vars.

**Note:** both `if` blocks are separate — the same `score` can update both `max_score` and `min_score` at first iteration.

---

### 18) Print extremes

```python
print(f"\nOverall Highest Score: {max_score} by {max_player} in Round {max_round}")
print(f"Overall Lowest Score: {min_score} by {min_player} in Round {min_round}")
```

* `f"...{var}..."` — f-strings: they fill in variable values into the string.
* `\n` — newline, makes formatting cleaner.
* Shows the final results.

---

### 19) Top performer per round

```python
print("\nTop performer per round:")
for r in range(num_rounds):
    top_score = -float('inf')
    top_player = ""
    for i in range(num_players):
        if scores[i][r] > top_score:
            top_score = scores[i][r]
            top_player = players[i]
    print(f"Round {r+1}: {top_player} with {top_score} points")
```

* For each round `r` (0..num_rounds-1):

  * Reset `top_score` to negative infinity (so first player’s score becomes top_score).
  * Loop over every player `i` and check `scores[i][r]` (player i's score in round r).
  * If that score is bigger than current `top_score`, update `top_score` and `top_player`.
  * After checking all players, print the winner for that round.

---

# Now: concrete run-through (trace) with real inputs — **line by line memory trace**

I’ll use this sample input so you can watch variables change:

* `num_players` = 2
* `num_rounds` = 3
* Player names & scores typed:

  * Player 1: `Alice` scores `10`, `5`, `7`
  * Player 2: `Bob`   scores `6`, `12`, `8`

Start: `players = []`, `scores = []`.

**After reading numbers**

* `num_players = 2`
* `num_rounds = 3`

**First outer loop iteration (p = 0):**

* Prompt: `Enter name of player 1:` user types `Alice` → `name = "Alice"`
* `players.append(name)` → `players = ["Alice"]`
* `player_scores = []`

Inner loop for Alice (`r` goes 0,1,2):

* r = 0 → prompt `Score for Alice in round 1:` user types `10` → `score = 10`

  * `player_scores.append(10)` → `player_scores = [10]`
* r = 1 → prompt `Score for Alice in round 2:` user types `5` → `score = 5`

  * `player_scores.append(5)` → `player_scores = [10, 5]`
* r = 2 → `Score for Alice in round 3:` user types `7` → `player_scores.append(7)` → `[10,5,7]`

After inner loop: `scores.append(player_scores)` → `scores = [[10,5,7]]`

**Second outer loop iteration (p = 1):**

* `Enter name of player 2:` user types `Bob` → `players = ["Alice", "Bob"]`
* `player_scores = []`
* r = 0 → `Score for Bob in round 1:` user types `6` → player_scores `[6]`
* r = 1 → `12` → player_scores `[6,12]`
* r = 2 → `8` → player_scores `[6,12,8]`
* append → `scores = [[10,5,7], [6,12,8]]`

**After input phase memory**

```
players = ["Alice", "Bob"]
scores = [
  [10, 5, 7],   # scores[0]
  [ 6,12, 8]    # scores[1]
]
```

**Initialize extremes**

```
max_score = -inf
min_score = +inf
max_player = ""
min_player = ""
max_round = 0
min_round = 0
```

**Now nested loops to find overall extremes**

We iterate `i` in `0..1`, and `j` in `0..2`.

* i=0, j=0 → score = scores[0][0] = 10

  * Is 10 > max_score (-inf)? yes → max_score=10, max_player="Alice", max_round = 0+1 = 1
  * Is 10 < min_score (+inf)? yes → min_score=10, min_player="Alice", min_round = 1
* i=0, j=1 → score = scores[0][1] = 5

  * Is 5 > max_score (10)? no → skip
  * Is 5 < min_score (10)? yes → min_score=5, min_player="Alice", min_round = 2
* i=0, j=2 → score = 7

  * 7 > max_score (10)? no
  * 7 < min_score (5)? no
* i=1, j=0 → score = 6

  * 6 > 10? no
  * 6 < 5? no
* i=1, j=1 → score = 12

  * 12 > 10? yes → max_score=12, max_player="Bob", max_round = 1+1 = 2
  * 12 < 5? no
* i=1, j=2 → score = 8

  * 8 > 12? no
  * 8 < 5? no

**After nested loop**

* `max_score = 12`, `max_player = "Bob"`, `max_round = 2`
* `min_score = 5`, `min_player = "Alice"`, `min_round = 2`

Printed:

```
Overall Highest Score: 12 by Bob in Round 2
Overall Lowest Score: 5 by Alice in Round 2
```

**Top performer per round loop**

* r = 0:

  * top_score = -inf
  * i=0 → scores[0][0] = 10 → 10 > -inf → top_score=10, top_player="Alice"
  * i=1 → scores[1][0] = 6  → 6 > 10? no
  * print: `Round 1: Alice with 10 points`
* r = 1:

  * top_score = -inf
  * i=0 → scores[0][1] = 5  → top_score=5, top_player="Alice"
  * i=1 → scores[1][1] = 12 → 12 > 5 → top_score=12, top_player="Bob"
  * print: `Round 2: Bob with 12 points`
* r = 2:

  * top_score = -inf
  * i=0 → 7 → top_score=7, top_player="Alice"
  * i=1 → 8 → 8 > 7 → top_score=8, top_player="Bob"
  * print: `Round 3: Bob with 8 points`

Final printed round winners:

```
Round 1: Alice with 10 points
Round 2: Bob with 12 points
Round 3: Bob with 8 points
```

# Extra tiny details & gotchas (word-by-word)

* `input()` always returns a **string**. Use `int()` to convert to number.
* `int("3")` -> `3`. `int("3.5")` raises `ValueError`. `int("abc")` raises `ValueError`.
* `range(n)` counts `0` to `n-1`. If you want human numbering, add `+1` when printing.
* `scores[i][j]` — first `[i]` picks player row, second `[j]` picks round column.
* `-float('inf')` and `float('inf')` are just safe initial extremes.
* `if score > max_score:` uses strict `>` (not `>=`). If you want to capture ties differently, logic changes.
* `append()` modifies the list **in place** (it does not return a new list).
* Loops are nested; total checks = `num_players * num_rounds`.
* Complexity: O(P * R), where P=num_players, R=num_rounds. For small tournaments that's fine.

---

# Short checklist so you can code this without surprises

* Convert inputs with `int()` and **only enter numbers** for scores and counts.
* Names are strings — you can use spaces, special chars.
* If you expect bad input, wrap conversions in `try/except ValueError` (we did not do that here).
* If multiple players tie for top score and you want all of them, you must collect them (this code only records the first one encountered).
